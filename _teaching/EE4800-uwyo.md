Course description: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are physical or engineered systems that are built from and operate upon the seamless integration of sensing, network communication, computing and control. Autonomous vehicles, aircraft, and robots are prime examples, because they move physically in space in a way that is determined by discrete computerized control algorithms. As a new frontier for computer systems, CPS technologies are transforming the way people interact with engineered systems. Autonomous CPS are designed to operate with a high degree of autonomy. Smart and autonomous CPS drive the innovation in application domains including intelligent transportation, manufacturing automation, environmental monitoring and control, healthcare and medicine.

This course is designed to introduce the technical foundations and robotic applications of cyber-physical systems to upper-level undergraduate students or graduate students. This course will prepare the students for pursuing advanced topics in areas such as connected autonomous vehicles, Internet of Things, and smart manufacturing.
