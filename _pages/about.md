Dr. Chao Jiang received his Ph.D. and master's degrees in electrical engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, USA and B.E. degree in measuring and control technology and instrumentation from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China. Before starting his Ph.D. study at Stevens, he worked as a research assistant in the Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Technology and Systems (Chongqing University), Ministry of Education, China. He joined the Department of Electrical Engineering  and Computer Science at the University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming in Fall 2019, where he is currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor. He is the recipient of the Innovation & Entrepreneurship Doctoral Fellowship at Stevens Institute of Technology from 2012 to 2016 and the recipient of the Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award in Electrical Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology in 2019. Dr. Chao Jiangâ€™s research interests include autonomous robots, human-robot interaction, multiple and distributed systems, healthcare robotics, robotic learning, and stochastic optimal control. His research is dedicated to advancing the fundamental understanding of intelligent behaviors in autonomous systems across a wide range of tasks and dynamic environments. His work focuses on developing intelligent and autonomous systems through the integration of control theory, machine learning, and stochastic optimization. Dr. Chao Jiang is Associate Editor of IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine (RAM), IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), American Control Conference (ACC), and IET Cyber-Systems and Robotics. He served on the Organizing Committee of the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS). He is a member of IEEE and IEEE Robotics and Automation Society.
